        <h2>About us:</h2>
        <p class="about-info">JYD Partners and Cassia Partners are two family owned companies who have a direct
            relationship with a prior business interest in a factory that is now manufacturing personal protective
            equipment to help combat the COVID-19 outbreak. Because we have an interest with the factory directly we
            can
            assure you that we are getting the best possible price to help combat the price gouging going in the
            market
            right now while still meeting your demand.

    <h2 id="shipping">Shipping Information:</h2>
    <p> All international and domestic shipping will be handled by us. We are partners with a
        supplier who has all the necessary import and export licenses to ensure quick delivery. Additionally we
        employ
        only the best customs brokers to make sure there are no delays on that front.</p>
    <h2>Shipping Method:</h2>
    <p> We have relationships and are in constant communication with all the passenger and
        cargo charter companies. If your order quantity is large enough we will arrange a charter for it upon
        completion
        of packaging at the factory. If your order is not big enough to fill a charter on its own, we can either
        send it
        immediately using a freight forwarder or try to group it with other smaller order quantities to fill a
        charter
        plane. </p>

    <h2>Contact:</h2>
    <p>Fill out our <a href="contact.html">contact form</a> with items you are interested in and quantity size and we
        will get back to you immediately. </p>
