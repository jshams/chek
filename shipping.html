        <h2>Shipping Information:</h2>
        <p> All international and domestic shipping will be handled by us. We are partners with a
            supplier who has all the necessary import and export licenses to ensure quick delivery. Additionally we
            employ
            only the best customs brokers to make sure there are no delays on that front.</p>
        <h2>Shipping Method:</h2>
        <p> We have relationships and are in constant communication with all the passenger and
            cargo charter companies. If your order quantity is large enough we will arrange a charter for it upon
            completion
            of packaging at the factory. If your order is not big enough to fill a charter on its own, we can either
            send it
            immediately using a freight forwarder or try to group it with other smaller order quantities to fill a
            charter
            plane. </p>
